		<p>I think schools should require uniforms. The reasons for that are because it creates unity, prepares students for a professional workplace and removes inappropiate wardrobe issues.<br><br> First of all, students wearing uniforms creates unity beacuse everyone will look the same and be equal.<br><br> Second of all, students wearing uniforms will prapare students for professional workplace. Students will be used to dressing formal and will be more likely to be hired.<br><br>Lastly, students wearing uniforms will remove inappropriate wardrobe issues. There will be no need to enforce a dress code and worry about what students wear. </p>

		<p>I believe college uniforms should not be mandatory for a number of reasons.<br><br>

Not only can we not expect every student to afford being able to dress professionally every week but I also doubt any positive effects would be significant.<br><br>
Putting on a uniform won’t change people enough to reduce bullying and a loosely worn uniform won’t exude professionalism. While people tend to act more professional in a setting where they dress professionally I find the setting has more to do with that behaviour than their wardrobe. A room full of students will still talk with their friends wether or not they’re in uniform.<br><br>

While I understand the benefits of dressing professionally  I find it unnecessary for even day classes. I wouldn’t be against it for special occasions, graduation or large student gatherings, but daily uniforms is excessive.
