		<p>I think schools should require uniforms. The reasons for that are because it creates unity, prepares students for a professional workplace and removes inappropiate wardrobe issues.<br><br> First of all, students wearing uniforms creates unity beacuse everyone will look the same and be equal.<br><br> Second of all, students wearing uniforms will prapare students for professional workplace. Students will be used to dressing formal and will be more likely to be hired.<br><br>Lastly, students wearing uniforms will remove inappropriate wardrobe issues. There will be no need to enforce a dress code and worry about what students wear. </p>
